#Problem Statement

Soccer league manager is a desktop application that helps to manage a group of clubs and their fixture as well as playing seasons. These teams will be playing for a win in each season by playing two matches with each team in each season. The final standing will show the ranking of each teams for the season.

#List of features

Below are brief list of feature that will be included:

The system will collect and store each teamâ€™s data. These are players and their manager, their stadium and who sponsor them.
It also creates a new season for the teams to compete on. That is, each season will be composed of a fixture, matches, and referees who preside and officiate.

Each match will be assigned automatically by the system before each season starts.
In addition, it will have a feature to add referees and their position.
Each match in the fixture will have a date/time, location(stadium), referees and score of the two teams playing.
A fixture in each season will show the summary of past and future matches and the details.
Team standing is the current rank of each team. It will be updated based on the result of scores gained from each match. The team with most point and goal score will be the winner for the given season.
